Title: Timbuk2 Classic Messenger Bag 2013 ; Description: What's this bag all about?Born in 1989 and raised on the backs of hard-working bike messengers in San Francisco, the Classic Messenger is a utilitarian work horse that just doesn't quit. Its colors and patterns wear well over time and its True Fit cam buckle, side-entry Napoleon pocket, color-coordinated, three-zipper front organizer, and incredibly useful slash pocket make this messenger a rather clever horse. ;
