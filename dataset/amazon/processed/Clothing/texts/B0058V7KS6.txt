Title: adidas Team Speed Duffel Bag (Medium) ; Description: The Team Speed Duffel Medium is built for superior team functionality. The large main compartment features an interior zippered pocket for your valuables. On one end cap of the duffel is a freshPAK ventilated compartment, great for keeping smelly shoes and gear separate from the rest of your stuff. On the other side of the bag is a zippered end cap pocket for additional storage. The large, easy-access front pocket with key fob is perfect for quickly stowing items. The ClimaProof water resistant bottom of the bag will protect your stuff from a wet field or gym floor. The dual adjustable, removable shoulder strap, padded air mesh shoulder pad, and wrapped haul handles let you carry your gear comfortably. The additional side haul handle allows for storage of the duffel in a locker and quick access to your bag in an overhead compartment. The screen-printed adidas brandmark and fast 3-Stripes complete the team look. The blank space on the opposite side of the bag and on the end caps leave plenty of space for team branding. ;
