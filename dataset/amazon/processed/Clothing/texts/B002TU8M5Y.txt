Title: 5.11 #64360 Women's TacLite Pro Pants ; Description: 5.11 Tactical has done it again. Our new Women's Taclite Pro Pant is ready for wear and we know this one will be a hit. Fashioned after our traditional 5.11 Tactical Pant, the new 5.11 Women's Taclite Pro Pant features a lightweight poly-cotton ripsotp fabric and a fully gusseted crotch that allows for full range of movement. These pants have pockets located for easy access to all of your gear. An external knife pocket on the right front side gives you easy access to a 5.11 Knife. Two cargo pockets are located on both thighs and a magazine/cell phone pocket is located over the left cargo pocket for quick access with your off-hand. The magazine and new knife pocket are reinforced with 100% Cordura nylon. We have kept our signature slash pockets in the rear along with the strap found on our 5.11 Tactical Pants.Cops have been waiting patiently for a lightweight version of our classic 5.11 Tactical Pant and the Women's Taclite Pro Pant fits the bill. Made of lightweight 65% polyester and 35% non-fading polycotton ripstop, you have a pant that is extremely functional and maintains a neat, clean and professional look. We&#x2019;ve also treated the pants with HT Teflon Wear-Resistant Finish for stain and soil resistance to maintain that good look no matter what the daily activity. The belt loops are thick enough to support a large belt to carry the weight of a sidearm, cuffs or other equipment. We use only YKK zippers, Prym snaps and Horn buttons so that you can rest assured that these Taclite Pro Pant will last. We&#x2019;ve also included our traditional clip loop on the front of the Women's Taclite Pro Pant for our great traditional 5.11 Tactical look. ;
