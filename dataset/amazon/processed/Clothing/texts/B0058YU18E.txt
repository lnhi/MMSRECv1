Title: Columbia Bora Bora Booney II Sun Hats ; Description: Featuring UPF 50 to block out 98% of harmful UVA and UVB rays and carrying the Skin Cancer Foundation&#x2019;s seal of recommendation, the Bora Bora Booney is definitely more than your average fishing hat. An Omni-Wick&#x2122; sweatband combines with a mesh vent panel (which is non UPF) to keep you cool and the sweat from dripping in your eyes. Quick-dry properties mean that even if this hat takes a dunk with you, it&#x2019;ll be dry in no time. An adjustable toggle customizes the hat&#x2019;s fit to your head. An adjustable chinstrap adds further security. ;
