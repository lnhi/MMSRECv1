Title: Handmade FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS ~ Set of 6 ~ From PERU! ; Description: Friendship bracelets are decorative bracelets made from cotton thread. They are exchanged all over the world as symbols of friendship and peace, mostly among young adults. Traditionally, friendship bracelets are handmade, so that the friend wearing the bracelet has a gift of time and energy as well as ornamentation. Friendship bracelets should be worn until they wear through and fall off naturally, a process which can take anywhere from a few months to over a year, depending on how the bracelet is made and worn.
The most common type of friendship bracelet is made with embroidery floss, which is sturdy and brightly colored. Other types of textiles can be used as well, although the thread is generally kept thin so that friendship bracelets will not get too bulky after they are made. In some cases, beads will be added to the friendship bracelet for extra decoration. The process for making a friendship bracelet is related to macrame or crochet, and involves making a series of small knots.
The roots of friendship bracelets can probably be found in Native and Central American traditional fiber arts, which included brightly colored wrist and ankle bands made from knotted threads. The designs used are also very common in Native American art, and include elements like stripes, simple animal figures, and checker patterns, depending on the skill of the crafts person. Friendship bracelets appear to have become popular in the United States in the 1970s, when many people were exploring traditional crafts, and soon spread to the rest of the world as well. ;
