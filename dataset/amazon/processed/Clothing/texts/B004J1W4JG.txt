The new PreCip coating has been improved for greater waterproof breathability, and the Marmot line of PreCip clothing has been outfitted with articulated designs and cleverly-placed pockets for optimal comfort and convenience.The key to this fabric is its updated barrier technology, a microporous polyurethane impregnated with silicon dioxide particles. This barrier creates small, numerous, consistent holes that allow small water vapor molecules to escape while blocking larger liquid particles. This keeps rain out while allows perspiration to work its way outside the garment, away from your body. When the weather turns fair, PreCip garments are compressible enough to be stuffed into a standard wide-mouth water bottle, and come in a variety of colors and styles for multiple applications.Lifetime WarrantyMarmot products include a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.About MarmotIn April 1971, University of California Santa Cruz students Eric Reynolds and Dave Huntley were in Alaska on the Juneau ice fields for a Glaciology school project. This was where the idea of Marmot, originally a collegiate climbing club, began. Reynolds and Huntley soon began making prototypes of down products such as vests and sleeping bags in their dorm room in Santa Cruz. By the spring of 1973, Reynolds and Huntley partnered with fellow climber Tom Boyce to open a modest rental and retail location, named Marmot Mountain Works, in a 100-year-old building in Grand Junction, Colorado.Their first large order was for 108, as the producer called them, "very puffy jackets" for the movie The Eiger Sanction, with Clint Eastwood, which helped make down outerwear fashionable. In 1976, Marmot was one of the first companies to recognize the value of a new technology being developed by W.L. Gore & Associates. Marmot was soon producing waterproof Gore-Tex sleeping bags, with Reynolds and Huntley testing early prototypes by sleeping in meat lockers and under fire sprinklers, and later introduced the waterproof/breathable fabric into nearly all Marmot products.From humble beginnings, Marmot and its product line have grown over the years, and today the company is headquartered in Rohnert Park, California, with offices all over the world and distribution in more than 60 countries. ;
