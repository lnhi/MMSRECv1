Add 5" to that measurement and round up to the next even number. This measurement is your band size. If your under bust measures 30.8", your band size is 36.Step 2: Recheck your band sizeTo double-check your band size, measure around your torso where the front bra straps begin. If this measurement is close to the band size (36), then your measurements are accurate.Step 3: Find your cup sizePlease measure loosely around the fullest part of your bust. Subtract the under bust measurement (30.8") from the full bust measurement (suppose it is 38.5") and get the difference (7.7"), which is your cup size. (4.7 to 5.5" A cup, 5.5 to 6.3" B cup, 6.3 to 7.1" C, 7.1 to 7.8" D, 7.8 to 8.7" DD, 8.7 to 9.5" DDD). From the list, we know your cup size is D (7.1 to 7.8" D), so your bra size is 36D (US size). ;
