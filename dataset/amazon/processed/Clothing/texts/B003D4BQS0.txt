Title: Banjo Brothers Backpack ; Description: Banjo Brothers 01150 Medium Backpack is a more comfortable option than a messenger bag for long rides or heavy loads, with two wide padded straps to distribute the weight evenly. Unfortunately your options have either been student backpacks that leak like a sieve, sit up too high, or cost a fortune. We designed our backpack with a full welded waterproof liner that is removable and replaceable if it is punctured. With a two-layer design, the outer ballistic nylon layer wears like iron, while the waterproof liner keeps contents dry in a downpour. This backpack has a 1500 cubic inch carrying capacity, and is 17-inches tall, 12-inches wide and 8-inches deep. It sits lower on the back than standard backpacks to reduce blind spots while riding, and features a chest strap and removable waist strap for stability. The quick-access side pocket fits mini-U lock and there is a large reflective stripe and a tab for safety light to keep you safe and seen while riding. ;
