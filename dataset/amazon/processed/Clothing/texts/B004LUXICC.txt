Title: Safety Cat Women's Self Defense Keychain - Teal ; Description: IMPORTANT: When Flying Pack in Check-in Luggage Only!
The Safety Cat is a self defense, personal protection tool designed mainly for women. As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through parking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker. Unfortunately, that can be cumbersome and awkward. If you're in the position of fighting off an attacker the keys may shift in your hand making it difficult for the fight to continue. The Safety Cat self defense keychain will eliminate this problem. When holding the Safety Cat, your two fingers will be placed in the eyes of the cat and the face of the cat will rest securely in the palm of your hand. The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly. Remember, the Safety Cat is used for self defense purposes only, but if you're fighting for your life the unique design of the Safety Cat is made for striking at the eyes of your attacker or attacking any fleshy part of the body. ;
