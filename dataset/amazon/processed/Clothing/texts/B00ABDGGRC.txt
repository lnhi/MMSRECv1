Title: Quantum Mechanix Star Trek The Next Generation Communicator Badge Replica ; Description: QMX's Star Trek: The Next Generation communicator badge was crafted using one of the only remaining sets of original molds, which was painstakingly restored in their artisan model shop. To get the colors and paint details, they studied an actual screen-used badge. And once the design of the original matched, QMX took the whole thing a step further, rendering the replica in gold and silver-finished metal. What sets this wearable badge apart from the original is the clasp, which uses strong, short-field magnets that are embedded in the badge itself and in a glossy backplate. No more pinholes in delicate fabric. It can even be worn on leather and suede. ;
