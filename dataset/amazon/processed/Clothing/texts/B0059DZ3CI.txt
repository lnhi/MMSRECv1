Title: Columbia Women's Kaleidaslope II Jacket, Black, X-Large ; Description: Updated with durable new ripstop fabric, this performance-packed jacket cancels out the cold with a decidedly feminine flourish. It&#x2019;s Omni-Shield&#xAE; advanced water repellent and packs extraordinary heat retention thanks to Omni-Heat&#xAE; thermal insulation and thermal reflective technology.  Soft, lustrous ripstop nylon and pretty pleating on the chest elevate the luxe factor, while lush high pile on the interior collar enhances coziness. Both supple and lightweight, the Kaleidaslope makes a great layering piece, and 3-point Interchange ability allows you to attach it to a corresponding Columbia shell for even more protection. Comfort cuffs ward off arctic gusts, while interior security and media pockets stash all your essentials securely. ;
