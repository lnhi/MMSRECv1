Title: ICETrekkers Diamond Grip Traction Cleats ; Description: The ICEtrekkers Diamond Grips provide aggressive traction in all winter walking conditions, from boilerplate ice to backcountry snow and everything in between. As a result, you won't slip while walking to your car in the parking lot or working in tough snow conditions. They grips are also effective when transitioning through gravel, rock and mud from icy surfaces. Made of case-hardened steel alloy and strung on steel aircraft cable, the grips' patented diamond beads have hundreds of biting edges that grip in all directions. With the diamond beads, it's almost impossible to slip. The Diamond Grips are also easy to put and take off thanks to the tough rubber sling, which fits almost every footwear type, from athletic shoes to work boots to dress shoes. And the sling remains elastic even in subzero temperatures, so you needn't worry about the grips falling off in deep snow. Diamond Grips are even self-clearing, so there's no snow or ice buildup. ;
