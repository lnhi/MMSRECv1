Ever wanted to just look like everyone else? Then this Minecraft head is for you! Featuring the famous Steve head from the hit indie video game, this 12" Head Mask will add a blast to any party or dess up event. "That's a nice everything you have there. It'd be a shame if something happened to it..." This is the line that you have to memorize so that you can appropriately portray the role of the Creeper after donning this mask. Of course, also work on hissing for long periods of time. It helps if you have the ability to randomly spawn in poorly-lit areas. Actually, that's a cool ability to have under any circumstances. ;
